## 1. Project notes

### What this is
**The Spelling Code** is a web app that teaches young children (launch target: about ages 4–7) to listen, read and spell using synthetic phonics: letters are taught in small clusters, and children immediately use them to build, read and spell real words. It is playful on purpose — a Detective Fox mascot, missions, badges — not test-like.

- **Live app:** https://the-spelling-code.netlify.app (public, no login)
- **Owner:** the product and curriculum owner decides what is taught; the developer (Claude) builds it and documents every substitution or gap here and in `content/word-library.md`.
- **Progress storage:** the child's browser (`localStorage`), one child profile, no accounts, no backend.
- **Feedback loop:** the Parent Dashboard has “Share my progress” and “Send feedback” buttons that open WhatsApp to the owner with a pre-filled message. No server involved.

### The six-level roadmap (from the Master Curriculum Blueprint v0.1)
| Level | Name | Approx. age | Blueprint modules | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sound Explorer | 4–5 | 10 | **Modules 1–7 built** (structure redesigned into letter clusters) |
| 2 | Word Builder | 5–6 | 8 | **Planning** — see the Level 2 plan below |
| 3 | Pattern Detective | 6–7 | 10 | Not started |
| 4 | Spelling Detective | 7–9 | 13 | Not started |
| 5 | Word Builder Pro | 9–11 | 10 | Not started |
| 6 | Word Master | 11–15 | 10 | Not started |

The blueprint's Level 1 has 10 one-skill modules; the app's Level 1 was redesigned (with the owner's approval) into letter-cluster modules, so its module list no longer matches the blueprint's.

### Where the build stands
| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Level 1 “Sound Explorer”, Modules 1–7 | **Built and deployed** (the agreed launch set) |
| Level 1 Modules 8–11 (sentences, tricky words, spiral review, master assessment) | Not built. Listed as inactive in `content/modules.json`. The Level 2 plan recommends moving sentences and tricky words into Level 2 rather than building them here. |
| Level 2 | Plan drafted, awaiting the owner's answers to its open questions |
| Level 3 and beyond, payments, accounts, teacher/school features, AI tutor, analytics, CMS, placement test | Out of scope until the owner asks |

**Launch plan:** 7 modules for ages roughly 4–6; add Module 8 (My First Sentences) if many 7-year-olds are in the audience. Modules 1–2 may be easy for confident 7-year-olds; “unlock all” in the Parent Dashboard lets a parent skip ahead.

### Curriculum design
- **Modules 1–2 — Listening Detective, Rhyme Detective:** general sound awareness, no letters. Built first and kept as designed.
- **Modules 3–6 — Letter Clusters** (Jolly Phonics / Letters and Sounds style): s a t p i n → m d g o c → k b h r e → l f u. That is all 19 Level 1 letters.
- **Every cluster has the same five lessons:** Meet the Letters (hear a word, pick its first letter) → Blend & Build (build a heard word from a tray of exactly the right letters) → Read the Words (read a written word, pick its picture) → Spell the Words (build a heard word from a tray with one extra decoy letter) → Cluster Challenge (scored, mixed).
- **Module 7 — Level 1 Review:** the same five lessons but mixing words from all clusters; the final Level 1 Challenge has 11 items.
- **Word rules:** simple CVC words only. No digraphs, blends, silent e, vowel teams or r-controlled vowels (“her”, “car” are excluded). Curriculum boundary: no c/k/ck choices, no ff/ll/ss doubling.
- **The c/k decision:** “c” is taught as a second letter for the /k/ sound (needed for cat, cap, can, cup). No question ever makes a child choose between c and k: they are never offered together as letter options, and a decoy tray never pairs one with a word using the other.
- **Letter sounds, not names:** text-to-speech reads a bare letter by its name (“em”), which teaches the wrong thing. So the app never speaks an isolated letter; “tap a word to sound it out” uses phoneme approximations (n → “nnn”, a → “ah”, p → “puh”) and then the whole word.
- **Mastery:** each lesson has a mastery threshold (80%). A module is complete when all its lessons are mastered.

### Access rules (free vs full)
- Module 1 is free. **Module 2 unlocks free if the child scores 85% or more on Module 1's challenge** (`FREE_UNLOCK_FROM_MODULE_ID = 1`, `MODULE_UNLOCK_THRESHOLD = 0.85` in `progressService.js`). This shortcut applies only at the Module 1 → 2 boundary.
- Every other module unlocks only after the previous module is fully mastered.
- Parent Dashboard has an “unlock all” switch for reviewing and testing.

### Architecture (how the code is organised)
- **Stack:** Vite + React (plain JS/JSX, no TypeScript). Tests use Node's built-in runner. No backend.
- **Content is data.** The whole curriculum lives in `content/*.json`. Only `src/services/contentService.js` imports it, so the loading method can change later without touching the app. Adding a lesson or question means adding JSON, not code (shapes are in `src/data/schemas.md`).
- **Activity registry.** `src/activities/registry.js` maps a lesson's `activity_type` to a React component. A new question type is one component plus one registry line.
- **Lesson flow.** `LessonPlayer.jsx` runs each lesson as a fixed sequence of stages: welcome → teach → watch (worked examples) → warm-up → solo → challenge → result → (practice-more if not mastered) → done.
- **Audio.** `audioService.js` plays real recordings when one exists (`REAL_AUDIO_FILES`, files in `public/audio/`), otherwise synthesizes a placeholder with Web Audio, and speaks words with the browser's speech voice. Real recordings deliberately bypass the synthesizer's shared compressor, which had been squashing loud/soft contrast.
- **Pictures.** Hand-drawn inline SVG in `Illustration.jsx`, plus image files in `public/img/words/` (Google Noto Emoji). A new picture-only word = drop an SVG in that folder, add the word to `WORD_KEYS` in `Icon.jsx` and `IMAGE_BG` in `Illustration.jsx`.
- **Progress and scoring.** `progressService.js` (attempts, best score, mastery that never reverts), `assessmentService.js` (scoring), `remediationService.js` (error tags → “practice more” advice).

### Decisions worth remembering
- **Loud and Soft uses recognisable real-world sounds from the owner's reference chart** — thunder and a clap (loud); wind, bell, birds, dripping water (soft). Drums and violins were tried and rejected: the owner did not want children learning “that's a drum”; the lesson is loudness only.
- **Audio sources:** thunder, wind and car were supplied by the owner. Birds and dripping water come from Mixkit (free commercial use, no credit needed). Pixabay's sounds were rejected as low quality. The birds clip was trimmed and volume-boosted because the original was very quiet.
- **Only one 85% unlock**, at Module 1 → 2, because the owner does not want later modules free.
- **The mascot** appears on the welcome header and result screen only — not the top bar, the Parent Dashboard or per-question feedback.
- **Playfulness:** the owner wants a game-like feel, and practice questions are randomised.
- **Design inspiration** was taken from other children's apps for look and feel only, never for curriculum content.

### Working agreements
1. **Pictures and other assets:** when the library runs thin, take freely licensed material from the internet on judgment; store the license and credits beside the files and note the source here.
2. **This document stays in sync.** After any content or code change: run `npm run docs`, run `npm test` (a test fails if this document is stale), commit, push to GitHub, and deploy.
3. **Everything is committed to GitHub**, code and curriculum together.

### How to run, test, publish
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local app at http://localhost:5173
npm test           # content integrity, scoring/progress logic, and this document being up to date
npm run docs       # regenerate this document
npm run build && npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --dir=dist    # publish
```
Netlify hosting is on the paid Personal plan. If a Netlify project ever shows a login wall, change that project's own Visitor access setting; the team-wide default only applies to new projects.

### Known gaps and ideas
- Only about 49 word pictures exist, so pictures repeat as wrong-answer options. The “fog” picture (a cloud) is the least clear. More pictures are welcome.
- Only two reliable loud sounds (thunder, clap) exist, so loud assessment items repeat practice items; these are marked with review flags in the tables below. A friendly real recording of another loud sound from the chart (for example a bang) would widen it.
- Sound-out audio depends on each device's speech voice and should be tried on a real phone.
- Clap, bell, clock, rain, phone and siren are still synthesized placeholders; real recordings would improve them.
- Modules 8–11 and Level 2 are not built.

### Build log
- Level 1 first built as 15 planned modules (one skill each), then **redesigned into letter-cluster modules** after playing through showed thin, repetitive word pools.
- Added the Detective Fox mascot, an accordion module list, the score-gated free unlock, the “unlock all” switch, WhatsApp sharing and feedback.
- Fixed per-example headers, missing pictures, decoy-letter demonstration, and the loud/soft audio (several rounds, ending with chart-based sounds).
- Added tap-to-sound-out for written words.
- Built Letter Clusters 1–4 and the Level 1 Review; added 11 word pictures from Noto Emoji; set up this master document and GitHub.
